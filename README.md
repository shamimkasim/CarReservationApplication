# CarReservationApplication
CarReservation.Api
1.	Separate the code into different layers: In DDD, it is common to have the following layers: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation (API in this case). Create separate projects or folders for each layer.
2.	Domain Layer: This layer contains the core business logic and entities of your application. Create classes that represent the domain entities and define their behaviors and relationships. For example, you can have the following classes in the Domain layer:
o	Car entity: Represents a car with properties like make, model, and ID.
o	Reservation entity: Represents a car reservation with properties like reservation ID, car ID, start time, and duration.
3.	Application Layer: This layer contains the application-specific logic and services. It acts as a bridge between the Domain layer and the Infrastructure layer. Create classes that define the application services and handle the use cases of your application. For example, you can have the following classes in the Application layer:
o	CarService: Handles operations related to cars, such as adding, updating, and removing cars.
o	ReservationService: Handles operations related to reservations, such as reserving a car and retrieving reservations.
4.	Infrastructure Layer: This layer is responsible for handling the data access and external dependencies of your application. Create classes that implement the interfaces defined in the Domain layer and provide the necessary infrastructure implementations. For example, you can have the following classes in the Infrastructure layer:
o	CarRepository: Implements the repository interface for accessing and persisting car data.
o	ReservationRepository: Implements the repository interface for accessing and persisting reservation data.
5.	Presentation Layer (API): This layer provides the API endpoints for interacting with your application. It is responsible for handling the HTTP requests and responses. In this case, you already have the CarController and ReservationController classes in the API layer.
